1. Euclidien Algorithm
------------------------
Let b be smaller than a
    gcd(a, b) = gcd(a-b, b)

Proof :
    Let 'g' be the GCD(a,b)
        a=gx and b=gy and GCD(x,y)=1 //otherwise there must be something common b/w a & b
        a-b = g(x-y)
        GCD(a-b, b) = g(x-y), otherwise it will contradict GCD(x,y)=1;
